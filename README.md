## Objective

In this task, I will be building my very first neural network with a single hidden layer, which represents a significant difference from the previous implementation using logistic regression. The main objective of this assignment is to create a 2-class classification neural network with one hidden layer, incorporating units with a non-linear activation function like tanh to enhance its capabilities.

Throughout this assignment, I will focus on computing the cross-entropy loss, a critical aspect of the training process, and mastering the implementation of both forward and backward propagation. These steps are essential for effectively training the neural network.
